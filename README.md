## NBA Predictions

This is a project that predicts player and team performance based on the current statistics available.

Right now, it can do the following:

1. Predict player performance by providing a number of statistics - player_performance_prediction.py
2. Predict whether team will win or lose based on the stastistics provided - team_win_loss.py
3. Compare and cluster players based on their performance - player_clustering.py
4. Compare offensive and defensive strength of the teams based on the games provided - team_strength.py
5. Use neural networks to project player's upcoming performances - player_trajectory.py

My goal for the future version is to make it interactable and grab the statistics of a team or player based on user's inputs.

Libraries and tools used:
